## Visualizations and takeaways

Something about topic model in general, what topics it produces

![Topic frequencies]('output/topic_frequencies.png')

Something about gender

![Topics' associations with gender]('output/gender_and_topics.png')

Female Topics Rare, but Grow Over Time--Except Women's Studies
"Topic 9: Civil War", "Topic 10: War", "Topic 12: Art", "Topic 14: Urban Spaces", "Topic 20: Womens Studies"

![Female topics over time]('../output/female_topics_over_time.png')

Male Topics Common, but Decline Over Time--esp. Music & Writing
"Topic 4: Writing", "Topic 5: Historical Figures", "Topic 7: American Revolution", "Topic 8: Philosophy", "Topic 15: Music"

## Method details

Something about STM model
About Loess regression

How I inferred gender

Something about dropping missing cases and when these tend to be


## Future work

Would be great to have demographic data om authors, like race and gender, or where they live, or fields of study, etc.

Would be great to look at interactions, like how does the gender/topic relationship change over time?
